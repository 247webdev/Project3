## Battleship
A JavaScript based take on the classic board game. 


The objective of this project is:

* To apply knowledge by building a web application from the ground up.
* We utilized JavaScript, jQuery,jQuery UI,Socket.IO, Node.js, Express, and Redis. 

## Game Play:
Each player in turn attemps to sink their opponent's fleet. To “hit” one of your opponent’s ships, you must click on the "Opponent" grid where you think one of their ships is located. Once a shot is called, the board will reveal if it is a “hit” or “miss.” If one of your ships gets hit,it will be marked on "Your Ships" by a red square.
